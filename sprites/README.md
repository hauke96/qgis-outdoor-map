# Edit sprites

This also works for adding new files.
The `sprite.json` then needs to be edited as mentioned below.

## SVG-based sprites

1. Edit the SVG file
2. Export SVG as PNG
3. Add rendered PNG to respective `sprite.xcf`
2. Save the file as `sprite.png`
3. Only needed when layout changed: Adjust `sprite.json` accordingly

## Raster sprites

1. Edit the layer in the `sprite.xcf` file
2. Save the file as `sprite.png`
3. Only needed when layout changed: Adjust `sprite.json` accordingly
