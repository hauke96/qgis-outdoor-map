# Outdoor hiking map

A map style for an OSM-based outdoor map focussed on hiking and trekking.
This map is a QGIS project based on OSM data turned into a GeoPackage file.

## Local setup

### 0. Prerequisites

First of all:
This whole setup is **Linux-based**.

Software that needs to be installed. These are the CLI commands that need to be available:

To generate and edit the style:

* `qgis` with the "Trackable QGIS Project"-plugin (to make `.qgs` files a bit mot git-friendly)
* `qtwebkit` (this is the name of Arch Linux package, make sure you install the package for your distro in order to render HTML in the QGIS-Layout)
* `osmium`
* `go` (golang; version >1.12, best use the version according to the `go.mod` file)

### 1. Download data

1. Execute `import-data.sh <region>` script (requires `osmium`) with the region name as parameter. The available regions are all listed at the bottom of the script.
  * This script downloads the data and crops it to the extent of the given region.
  * This script also creates the required `data/data.gpkg` file for QGIS.

## Create printable PDF

1. Create a new QGIS print layout or use the default one in thise project
2. Adjust the virtual layers (within the "legend" map theme) so that your legend contains all wanted items in correct groups
3. Adjust the theme and create the PDF (or whatever output you want)

## Style guide

### General considerations

* **Hiking infrastructure has a higher precedence over non-hiking infrastructure.** Example: Drinking water POIs are already visible at zoom level 12, advanced trails have a bright yellow background and generally all hiking trails are directly recognizable.
* **Hiking relevant data only.** Things, that are not related or important for hikers (or other outdoor enthusiasts) are irrelevant. This includes for example parking spaces. Yes, people arrive by car but why should a map for hiking include parking if you use your phone for car navigation and finding a parking spot?
* **Use as few different colors amd font-styles as possible.** Sometimes, adjustments of font or icon colors are needed for better visualization, but keep that to a minimum.
* **Orientate yourself by the [2014 material design color palette](https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#tools-for-picking-colors).** These colors work quite well but I sometimes change some parameters of the color where appropriate. But if such a color works, then take it.
* **Sprites should be of high quality.** When possible, create large sprites and then use the scale factor to scale them down for the map. This ensures sharp icons and the possibility for hires maps.

_More guidelines will be added over time._

### Concrete guides

* Outlines
  * Many things have outlines (e.g. labels, lines, some icons, etc.)
  * Style: White, 0.5mm, 50% opacity
* Font
  * Font: Open Sans 
  * Font sizes:
    * Normal (e.g. contour labels, street/trail names): 6pt
    * Important (e.g. forest or railway station name): 8pt
    * Very important (e.g. city name): 10pt
    * Exceptions (e.g. for nature reserve areas) are allowed
* Labels:
  * Generally: White outline as described above
  * Trail and street names:
    * On line
    * Curved
* Road:
  * 0.5mm outline of light gray (#9E9E9E)

## TODOs

* Handle ways under construction, private ways and those with access=no
* Add scale and scale-bar to layout
* Adjust tile-proxy to serve multiple endpoints under one port

# DEPRECATED DOC

QGIS outdoor map

A simple map for outdoor activities as [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/) project for manual editing, printing, layouting, etc.

<img align="center" style="width: 100%;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hauke96/qgis-outdoor-map/main/example-hiking-map.jpg">

QGIS enables you to create PDF or image exports which then can be printed:

# How to use

1. Make sure you have a postgres database running (see section ["Docker Setup"](#docker-setup) to start the database as a docker container)
2. Import data into the database (see ["Fill database"](#fill-database))
3. Read the ["QGIS setup"](#qgis-setup) section
4. Load the [`map.qgs`](map.qgs) project file
5. Take a look at the ["Render map"](#render-map) section on how to render the map to PDF/PNG

## Docker Setup

This QGIS-project expects a **PostGIS** database with the credentials *postgres* and *secret*.
To make things easier there's a docker-compose file to start everything within a couple of seconds.

### Setup

This folder contains the following docker related files:

* [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml): Core docker file, needed to tell docker what to start. This also contains credentials for the database.
* [`init.sh`](init.sh): Simple script to fill a running database.
  * `init.sh file.pbf` will remove the current data and just import `file.pbf`
  * `init.sh --append file.pbf` will append the data from `file.pbf` to the current database
* [`.pgpass`](.pgpass): Contains the credentials for the database. This is used by the `init.sh` script to be able to log into the database without user interactions.
* [`map.qgs`](map.qgs): The actual QGIS project
* [`data/import-layout-data.sh`](data/import-layout-data.sh): Downloads old/missing data and imports it specifically for a given layout.

### Start

To start everything using docker, do the following:

1. Execute the following command within this folder: `docker-compose up --build`. This starts the docker container with an empty postgres database and postgis plugin.

That's it, your database is now running and can be filled with data.

## Fill database

Make sure the database is running. Now we can add some data to it:

1. Download data
  * **When importing for a specific layout:** Go into the `data` folder and execute the `import-layout-data.sh` script with the layout name as parameter (e.g. `a2-thueringer-wald`).
  * **When importing arbitrary data:** Get a PBF-file (e.g. downloading from [Geofabrik](https://download.geofabrik.de/index.html)) of the area you want to work on. Downloading large areas just make things slow, so download only the stuff you need.
2. Fill the database with `init.sh your-data.pbf`. **Caution:** This removes the existing content of the database! Use `--append` to just append to existing data without wiping the database.

### Combine multiple Extracts

Sometimes a region is across multiple Geofabrik extracts (e.g. your region covers Lower Saxony and Hamburg), in this case you have to combine multiple PBF-files into one.

The script `./data/import-layout-data.sh` does that, so take a look at its source code.

**Example: Fischbek**

The Hamburg-extract from Geofabrik does not contain the whole area of Fischbeker Heide, so we have to combine it with the Lower Saxony extract:

* Download Hamburg and Lower Saxony extracts
* Cutout irrelevant stuff from Lower Saxony: `osmium extract -b 9.7685,53.4721,9.973,53.3978 niedersachsen-latest.osm.pbf --overwrite -o niedersachsen-latest-cutout.osm.pbf`
* Merge them: `osmium merge hamburg-latest.osm.pbf niedersachsen-latest-cutout.osm.pbf --overwrite -o hh-nds.pbf`
* Import it: `./init.sh hh-nds.pbf`

### Update data

Updating data works just like in the ["Fill database"](#fill-database) step.

1. Download latest PBF file
2. Import into existing (filled or empty) database with `init.sh your-data.pbf`. **Caution:** This removes the existing content of the database! If you want to append data to the existing database use the `--append` flag (s. above).

This also works while QGIS is running.

### Append data to database

Just use the `--append` parameter for the `init.sh` script: `init.sh --append file.pbf`

## Hillshading & contour lines

Use the [tutorial in this repo](./HILLSHADE_CONTOURS.md) to create your own hillshade and contour lines files.
This project has two layers (one for hillshading and one for contour lines), you just need to change the source to a lokcal `.tif` (for hillshading) or `.gpkg` (for contours) file.

For hillshading, there's also a public service provided by ESRI but the contours must be created locally (until I find a suitable public layer for that).

## QGIS setup

1. Make sure you use the latest QGIS version (as of 15th December 3.22)
2. If you want to modify the project and create a pull-request: 
  1. Install the extension "Trackable QGIS Project" (this orders the XML attributes in the project file alphabetically so that the file is better trackable by git)
  2. Collapse all layers before committing (just to keep the project clean)

## Render map

Make sure the project is loaded in QGIS and that you have the data loaded into your database.

1. Create a layout or change an existing one
2. Add the OSM attribution if you use OSM data
3. Use the normal QGIS mechanisms to export the layout to PDF, PNG, ...

### Render via Terminal/CLI

1. Make sure you created your layout in QGIS
2. Use the `render-layout.py` script to render a single layout (ude `render-layout.py --help` for more information)

### Render all pre-defined layouts

There are some pre-defined layouts (such as `a2-fischbeker-heide`) wich legend, scale bar, attribution and everything.
Calling the script `render-all.sh` renders them all as PDF and PNG files, no parameter needed.

# Style guideline

Some guidelines how the map style has been developed

### Simplicity

Avoid unnecessary details and too many object.
For example there's no styling difference between several road types like service, residential oder unclassified.

### Font sizes

Normal font size is **6pt** and used for streets and small places (e.g. `place=square`).
But there are situations for larger fonts:

#### 6pt
* streets
* hotels, guest houses

#### 8pt
* small places
* grass areas
* forest
* heath
* hamlet, square, locality
* landuses (education, military, etc.)
* train stations

#### 10pt
* village, city quarter
* protected area

#### 12pt
* suburb

#### 14pt
* city

### Colors

The colors come from the [material design colore palette](https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#tools-for-picking-colors) and objects of the same kind have usually the same saturation and just different color tones.
For example do all normal roads have the 200 saturation and all tunnel roads the 100 saturation.

**Exceptions:**

* Tidalflat areas have `#bbd2dc` (which is the "Blue Grey 100" color but with 20% saturation and 90% brightness instead)
* Pitches have `#bde2d2` (the middle between "Green 100" and "Teal 100")
* Sport centres have `#e8f5e9` ("Green 50" but with saturation of 10 instead of 5)
* Tracks have the `#a1887f` color but with 20¬∞ hue and 75% saturation (resulting in `#a14728`)
* Commercial areas have `#ffdee2` (basically "Red 100" with 13% saturation instead of 20%)
* Bare rock and gravel have `#ebe4d7` as background filling (the "Brown 100" but a bit lighter and a bit more yellow)
* Heath has `#eee09c` (the "Lime 200" but with 50% hue value)
